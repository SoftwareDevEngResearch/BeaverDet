A collection of detonation research tools from the fine folks at Oregon State University's [P-lab](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/propulsion-laboratory). Boom boom.

This package (and tube) is still under construction. Current work is on polishing up a series of functions to assist in the design of a detonation tube with optical access (and, physically, getting said tube to run). Schlieren image analysis software will be added once I get my tube up and running, collect some images, and figure out how to turn them into cell size measurements programatically.

For any questions or issues, feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:cartemic@oregonstate.edu).
